ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m @JoryVardas
I love C++ (with all of its quirks) and learning new things.

To see some of the projects I'm working on take a look around my repositories. Some of the projects I have uploaded are fairly old and outdated, but from each of them I've learned and feel they deserve to be seen.

I've also made a few websites, with Matt Harvey doing the visual design for them, you should check them out.
